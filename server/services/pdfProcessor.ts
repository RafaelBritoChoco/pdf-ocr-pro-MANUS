8. "Threat of Serious Injury" means a situation in which a substantial increase of preferential imports is of a nature so as to cause "serious injury" to domestic products, and that such Injury, although not yet existing is clearly imminent. A determination of threat of serious injury shall be based on facts and not on mere allegation, conjecture, or remote or hypothetical possibility.

ARTICLE V - SAFEGUARD MEASURES

1. If any product, which is the subject of a concession under this Agreement, is imported into the territory of a Contracting Party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to domestic producers, the importing Contracting Party may, with prior consultations except in critical circumstances, suspend provisionally without discrimination the concession accorded under the Agreement.

2. When action has been taken by a Contracting Party in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall simultaneously notify the other Contracting Party and the Committee established under Article XI.

2. Any Contracting Party may adopt or maintain measures necessary to prevent circumvention of the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII - BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any Contracting Party facing balance of payments difficulties may take such measures as are necessary to safeguard its external financial position and balance of payments.

2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be progressively relaxed as the balance of payments situation improves.

ARTICLE IX - TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE
